<h2 style="color:Black;">1. Motivation</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What is your dataset?
</p> 

<p>
The republic of Syria has been enduring a civil war for many years now, and the war has taken its toll on the population in the country. The death count estimates to around half a million and is still going, which has led to massive waves of refugees fleeing the country. The people who are still living in the countries are often exposed to violent fights in the cities, which increases the death count unless help is provided to the population. The dataset we will be using in this project consist of the fatalities in the the war in Syria in 2017. It also gives the details of what has happened, the date and time and who reported the conflict.  
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Why did you choose this/these particular dataset?
</p> 

<p> We decided to choose this dataset because we thought it would be nice to create a map, that shows the locations of the conflicts in the country, so that the organisations and help that is working in the country can see the locations where help is needed the most. Further more it is also good for people who live in the country to see where there is most danger so they maybe can avoid going to those places, so it can be acted like a warning device for the people of Syria. The goal in general is to establish a safer enviroment for civillians living under constant threats in the country and help them getting medical care fast when something happens. 
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What is your goal for the end user's experience?
</p> 


<p> The goal for the end user is to let them have an overview of the map of Syria and see all the fatalities that has happened in 2017. They should also be able to use the timeline provided to toggle between different time periods as desired. 
</p> 









<h2 style="color:Black;">2. Basic stats. Lets understand the dataset better</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing?
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis?
</p> 













<h2 style="color:Black;">3. Genre. Which genre of data story did you use</h2>

<p> The genre will be done in a form of annotated chart, which will consist of a map showing the locations, and timeline showing the fatalities in the time periods.
</p> 




<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?
</p> 
<p> Visual Narrative consists of the 3 main categories, Visual Structuring, Highlighting and Transition Guidance. We used Visual Structuring for communicating structure of the narrative for users. It helps giving them an good overview from the start. This is done by having a timeline slider where the idea is to give user good overview of things and let them be able to track the data of their on own desire. They can basically choose what they want to view for a more personalized experience. THis also allows the user to explore and see how the situations have changed over different times.  
We also used highlighting to give more depth to the visual part, so users can easily spot different elements. It is primary done by using different colors that has been chosen carefully by us, to give the best effect possible. We want to easily let users eyes focusing on the most important ares on the map (Fatality incidents). Further we would like to add motions, where user can click a Play-button and it will automatically diplay all the fatalities from the beginning of the dataset, so the users can see all the changes in a smooth way, kind of like a movie clip.

<h2 style="color:Black;">4. Visualizations</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Explain the visualizations you have chosen.
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Why are they right for the story you want to tell?
</p> 















<h2 style="color:Black;">5. Discussion. Think critically about your creation</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What went well?
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What is still missing? What could be improved, why?
