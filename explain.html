<h2 style="color:Black;">1. Motivation</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What is your dataset?
</p> 

<p>
The republic of Syria has been enduring a civil war for many years now, and the war has taken its toll on the population in the country. The death count estimates to around half a million and is still going, which has led to massive waves of refugees fleeing the country. The people who are still living in the countries are often exposed to violent fights in the cities, which increases the death count unless help is provided to the population. The dataset we will be using in this project consist of the fatalities in the the war in Syria in 2017. It also gives the details of what has happened, the date and time and who reported the conflict.   
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Why did you choose this/these particular dataset?
</p> 

<p> We decided to choose this dataset because we thought it would be nice to create a map, that shows the locations of the conflicts in the country, so that the organisations and help that is working in the country can see the locations where help is needed the most. Further more it is also good for people who live in the country to see where there is most danger so they maybe can avoid going to those places, so it can be acted like a warning device for the people of Syria. 
The goal in general is to establish a safer enviroment for civillians living under constant threats in the country and help them getting medical care as fast as possible when something happens. 
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What is your goal for the end user's experience?
</p> 


<p> The goal for the end user is to let them have an overview of the map of Syria and see all the fatalities that has happened since 2017. They should also be able to use the timeline slide provided to toggle between different time periods as desired. The user shall also be able to click on individual parts of the map and then a updated table with info will show up, like how many fatality incidents have happened in a specific part of the map. 
</p> 









<h2 style="color:Black;">2. Basic stats. Lets understand the dataset better</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing?
</p> 


<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis?
</p> 













<h2 style="color:Black;">3. Genre. Which genre of data story did you use</h2>

<p> The genre will be done in a form of annotated chart, which will consist of a map showing the locations alongside fatality incidents with dots, and a timeline slider showing the fatalities in different time periods from start 2017. Both the map and timeline shall be interacticve for users to arhieve a more personlizewd experience. 
</p> 




<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?
</p> 
<p> Visual Narrative consists of the 3 main categories, Visual Structuring, Highlighting and Transition Guidance. We used Visual Structuring for communicating structure of the narrative for users. It helps giving them an good overview from the start. It is done letting the user first be met with a map of Syrien in picture form, that is directly linked with the dataset we have chosen. 
Then there will be provided with a timeline slider below the map chart, where the idea is to give user good overview of things and let them be able to track the data of their own desire and in general interact with the data. They can basically choose what they want to view for a more personalized experience, like if they only want to see fatalities incidents in April 2017, then they can do that and the map chart will immediately be updated and provide the user with the wanted information. This allows the user to explore and see how the situations have changed over different times and the chart above will be updated along with users desire and chosen actions from the timeline slider.  
We also used highlighting to give more depth to the visual part, so users can easily spot different elements. It is primary done by using different colors that has been chosen carefully by us, to give the best effect possible. We want to easily let users eyes focusing on the most important areas on the map (Fatality incidents). 
The conflict dots that represent each fatality incidents will be colored with yellow dots, since its an strong color and can easily to noticed. The dots will be removed/added according to what timeframe the user wants to view from. The map of Syrien will also be divided with different colors to showcase different cities, so each city will be highlighted with different color. This will let users easily see the seperations of Syrien and it will be usefull for people who are not too familiar with the country.  
Further we would like to add motions, where user can click a Play-button and it will automatically diplay all the fatalities from the beginning of the dataset to current, so the users can see all the changes in a smooth way, kind of like a movie clip. This button will act as an catalyst to let the user begin the presentation. When playing the presentation, an indicator will be highlighted on the timeline slider, to let the user know where they are when playing the presentation, so they easily can track the progress. 
</p> 







<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?
</p> 

<p> Narrative Structure consists of 3 categories, Ordering, Interactivity and Messaging. 
Interactivity is used for letting the user interact with the data that is being shown on the map chart. The user will be able to manipulate the visulization with filtering/selecting of their desired timeframe to see the fatality incidents. They can broaden or shorten the timeline slider as they want from days, weeks or monthes, so its easily manipulated. 
Interactitivty is also used on the map chart, so the user can simply click on the different parts of Syria and quickly get an updated table on all fatality incidents that has happened specific in that area. 
Messaging technique is used for letting the visulization communicate with the user. This is done by adding labels on the map chart, to inform the user what the chart is showing and explain about the map. 
Then labels are added on the timeline slider to show the dates, which can be year, month, week, day. At the same time there is also numbers on the timeline to indicate fatality incidents on different monthes.
</p>









<h2 style="color:Black;">4. Visualizations</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Explain the visualizations you have chosen.
</p> 

<p> The visulizations starts with the map chart of Syrien along with all the fatality incidents since the beginning of 2017, so it is directly showcasing the main purpose of the dataset. This will allow the user to immediately get involved with the data and can quickly gain a overview of the situation that is happening in Syrien.
The timeline slider is added for the purpose of letting user have knowledge of the number of incidents in different timeperiod. It is also designed to let user interact with the data, by letting the user choose the desired timeframe with the incidents. 

The idea is to create a minimalistic but yet effective way of showing the fatality incidents, so people can easily and quickly get the wanted information, both at current situation and at different timespace. It is also a good idea to not include too much text or other distracting things on the visulizations to divide or unfocus the user's view. The reason is because we are talking about life and death here and usually help organizations/people are in stressed situations most of the time, so it is only logical that the visulization needs to quickly provide usefull information, so they can act, analyse, see where there is need for help the most or make a move immediately according to the given data. For people living in the country, it is a good way to quickly get an historic background on where most fatality incidents happens, so they maybe can avoid those places as much as possible. They can of course also use it to see the current situation of the country to get updated constantly.
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Why are they right for the story you want to tell?
</p> 

<p>They are right because this visulization will also be used as an emergency tool, so it needs to be fast and effective to showcase the data and it only needs to show the most important data. 
</p>













<h2 style="color:Black;">5. Discussion. Think critically about your creation</h2>
